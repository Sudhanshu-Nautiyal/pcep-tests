# 4. What is the output of the following code
print(9 ** 3 ** 0 ** 1)

# Answer: 9

# Explanation: The ** operator is used to raise the number on the left to the
# power of the exponent of the right. The expression is evaluated from the
# right to left, and therefore it results in 9**0, which is 9.
