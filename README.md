## What is PCEP Certification?

PCEP Python Entry Level Programmer certification is your first step into the world of Python. Python is the world's top most popular programming language, used extensively in Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences as well as in general-purpose computing area. Getting professional accreditation in Python is surely a feather in your programmer's hat and a strong step in your professional career.

## What does this course offer you?

This course consists of 6 practice tests similar to what you see in a real certification exam. Each of the tests consists of 30 questions, timed at 45 minutes. The questions are multiple-choice and multiple-select. Each question is carefully curated to fit the PCEP's certification goal. Every question is associated with a knowledge area. The answers are randomized every time you take a test. The test covers all the modules as per the PCEP syllabus. Once the test was taken, you will get an instant result report with categories of strength to weakness. You can re-take the tests over and over again as and when it suits you.
