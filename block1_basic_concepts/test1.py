# 1. What do you expect the following code to printout:

print("Hello","World", end=" ")
print("Python")
# Hello World Python
# The keyword argument end=" " will affect the second line to be printed at the end of the first line.
# The default end is a newline but here we are altering it to " " which means the next print statement will
# be printed on the same line with a space delimiter
